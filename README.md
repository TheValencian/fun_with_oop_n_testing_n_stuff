# Fun with OOP, Testing, and Stuff

Some random and some not so random programming examples, projects, and snippets.

Some complete and some not so complete programming examples, projects, and snippets.

Some useful and some not so useful programming examples, projects, and snippets.

Well... you get the idea.

## Examples, Projects, and Snippets

### Graphing Calculator (PHP Implementation)

Yes, you read that right. Implemented in PHP. As PHP is currently my (@erikthedeveloper) primary programming language of choice, I wanted to take an assignment given at DSU (Dixie State University) and solve/implement it using PHP. The language the project will be implemented (and eventually posted in some form here) is Python.


- Infix to Postfix Translator
- Postfix Evaluator
- More?...

- Dependencies managed through composer
- PSR-4 Structure (for autloading)
- TDD (Test Driven Development) using PHPSpec
- Maybe some other useful goodies thrown in for good measure

Composer? ... PHPSpec? ... Huh?

This about sums it up (assuming a fresh `git clone` and `cd` into the php calc directory...)
